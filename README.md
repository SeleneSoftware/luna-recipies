# Luna Package Management Recipies

This is the repository for all the recipies that Luna will use.  

## Installation

There is no installation

## Usage

```bash
luna
```

This application is a TUI utilizing [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).  There will be a method for searching and installing packages from within the application.  No need for an overly complicated cli.

## Submitting a Recipie
Fork the repo and use the recipie template to create the recipie for your application.  Once completed, make a pull request against the recipies branch.  The JSON file in the main branch will update automatically once the pull request has been merged (hopefully).
